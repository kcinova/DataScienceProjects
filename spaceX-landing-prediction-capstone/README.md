## Introduction

In this project, we predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 will successfully land, enabling the estimation of launch costs. This prediction is good to know for competing companies seeking to bid against SpaceX for launch contracts.

## About the Course

This project is part of the **Applied Data Science Capstone** course by IBM, which is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The course provides practical experience in applying data science methodologies and machine learning techniques.

## Data Collection and Preparation

We collected data using RESTful APIs and web scraping. The data was cleaned and processed, resulting in multiple datasets stored in CSV files and a SQLite database for efficient querying and manipulation.

- [Collecting the Data via Web Scraping](https://github.com/kcinova/data-science/blob/main/spaceX-landing-prediction-capstone/code/2-spacex-webscraping.ipynb)
- [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/kcinova/data-science/blob/main/spaceX-landing-prediction-capstone/code/3-spacex-data-wrangling.ipynb)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed extensive EDA using SQL and various visualization tools. Insights were gathered about the launch outcomes, launch sites, and other key features.

- [Data Visualization and Exploration](https://github.com/kcinova/data-science/blob/main/spaceX-landing-prediction-capstone/code/5-spacex-eda-dataviz.ipynb)

## Model Development

[Prediction with machine learning](https://github.com/kcinova/data-science/blob/main/spaceX-landing-prediction-capstone/code/6-spacex-machine-learning-prediction.jupyterlite.ipynb)

We developed and compared several machine learning models, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## Results and Findings

Evaluation metrics were used to determine the best model, focusing on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Best Model: **Decision Tree**
- **Validation Accuracy**: 0.8732
- **Test Accuracy**: 0.8333
