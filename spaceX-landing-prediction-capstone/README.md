## Introduction

In this project, we predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 will successfully land, enabling the estimation of launch costs. This prediction is critical for competing companies seeking to bid against SpaceX for launch contracts.

## About the Course

This project is part of the **Applied Data Science Capstone** course by IBM, which is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The course provides practical experience in applying data science methodologies and machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

### Data

- **`dataset_part_1.csv`**: Initial dataset collected.
- **`dataset_part_2.csv`**: Processed and cleaned dataset.
- **`dataset_part_3.csv`**: Final dataset used for machine learning.
- **`my_data1.db`**: SQLite database for data storage and manipulation.
- **`spacex_web_scraped.csv`**: Data obtained via web scraping.

### Notebooks

- **`1-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb`**: Data collection via API.
- **`2-spacex-webscraping.ipynb`**: Data scraping from web sources.
- **`3-spacex-data-wrangling.ipynb`**: Data cleaning and wrangling processes.
- **`4-spacex-eda-sql-sqlite.ipynb`**: EDA using SQL and SQLite.
- **`5-spacex-eda-dataviz.ipynb`**: Data visualization and exploration.
- **`6-spacex-machine-learning-prediction.jupyterlite.ipynb`**: Machine learning model development and evaluation.

## Data Collection and Preparation

We collected data using RESTful APIs and web scraping. The data was cleaned and processed, resulting in multiple datasets stored in CSV files and a SQLite database for efficient querying and manipulation.

- [Collecting the Data via API](https://github.com/kcinova/data-science/blob/main/spaceX-landing-prediction-capstone/code/1-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb)
- [Collecting the Data via Web Scraping](https://github.com/kcinova/data-science/blob/main/spaceX-landing-prediction-capstone/code/2-spacex-webscraping.ipynb)
- [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/kcinova/data-science/blob/main/spaceX-landing-prediction-capstone/code/3-spacex-data-wrangling.ipynb)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed extensive EDA using SQL and various visualization tools. Insights were gathered about the launch outcomes, launch sites, and other key features.

## Model Development

We developed and compared several machine learning models, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## Results and Findings

The evaluation metrics for the models included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The best model based on the evaluation metrics was identified. SVM, and KNN showed similar performance metrics.

### Best Model: **Logistic Regression**
- **Accuracy**: 0.8333
- **Precision**: 0.8000
- **Recall**: 1.0000
- **F1 Score**: 0.8889
